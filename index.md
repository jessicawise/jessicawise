<br />
<strong>Role:</strong> User Researcher, UX Designer, UX Developer
<br />
<strong>About:</strong> ReEmploy is a work in progress web application that came about when I was laid off work. I had never been laid off before and being in that situation left me feeling lost and without purpose. An engineering friend of mine proposed the idea to me to help me from being a lump in my apartment. The project is still a work in progress but it helped me realize that I wanted to get back to my creative roots. With that in mind, working on the project helped me solidify my decision in switching my career to UX Design/Development.

### Venture.ng

<strong>Role:</strong> User Researcher, UX Designer
<br />
<strong>About:</strong> Right after the ReEmploy idea was pitched to me, I immediately enrolled in General Assembly's UX Design 5 week course. The course is currently ongoing and not set to end until April 21st. The project for the course was to create a website or application for a problem that we were interested in. My idea came from a hobby that I partake in with my college friends. They were very supportive during my time out of work and encouraged me to continue playing Dungeons and Dragons with them on the weekend, so I wasn't just loafing in bed after working on ReEmploy. My friends are all in different states and because of that, playing a tabletop game hasn't been easy. Many of the virtual tabletop applications we've tried aren't user friendly and can be very frustrating. This was the driving force for me to design Venture.ng, a user friendly yet still robust virtual tabletop web application. This is a work in progress design, as it will be worked on in steps during my General Assembly course. I also plan to continue working on it afterwards to completely solidify the entire application design.


## About

I am a Columbus, Ohio native gone full Bostonian. I attended and graduated from Columbus College of Art and Design with a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Animation. To be more exact, I graduated exclusively wanting to be a 2D Animator. At the time of graduating the world was moving away from 2D and more towards 3D Animation (this was before shows like Super Jail became popular and Flash animations made a comeback). So, as not to be left behind or without options I met my signifigant other, moved to Western Massachusetts, and started a career in Customer Service! I still made flash animations in my free time but I had more or less told my creative background to take a back seat because we had to be an adult.

After two years, we left our Western Massachusetts life and moved to Boston because my signifigant other had found a job in the city. My career then shifted to Customer Success and that's where I have been ever since. However, after a recent layoff I have decided to get back to my more creative roots. In my time after moving to MA, I taught myself HTML, CSS and some pretty basic Javascript. It was time, I decided, to try to become a UX Designer/Developer. I have since enrolled in General Assembly's UX Design 5 week course and started on a personal project (outlined below).

My goal is to take the experiences I have gained while being a Customer Success Manager and help them make me a better UX Designer/Developer. Outside of work, I play video games, take bike rides when the Nor'Easters decide to take a break, hike, work on for fun animations, play with my two cats, and currently have plans of visiting Germany in the Fall.

Thanks for checking out my portfolio website and don't hesitate to reach out to me!
