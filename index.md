### ReEmploy

Role: User Researcher, UX Designer, UX Developer
About: ReEmploy is a work in progress web application that came about when I was laid off work. I had never been laid off before and being in that situation left me feeling lost and without purpose. An engineering friend of mine proposed the idea to me to help me from being a lump in my apartment. The project is still a work in progress but it helped me realize that I wanted to get back to my creative roots. With that in mind, working on the project helped me solidify my decision in switching my career to UX Design/Development.

### Venture.ng

Role: User Researcher, UX Designer
About: Right after the ReEmploy idea was pitched to me, I immediately enrolled in General Assembly's UX Design 5 week course. The course is currently ongoing and not set to end until April 21st. The project for the course was to create a website or application for a problem that we were interested in. My idea came from a hobby that I partake in with my college friends. They were very supportive during my time out of work and encouraged me to continue playing Dungeons and Dragons with them on the weekend, so I wasn't just loafing in bed after working on ReEmploy. My friends are all in different states and because of that, playing a tabletop game hasn't been easy. Many of the virtual tabletop applications we've tried aren't user friendly and can be very frustrating. This was the driving force for me to design Venture.ng, a user friendly yet still robust virtual tabletop web application. This is a work in progress design, as it will be worked on in steps during my General Assembly course. I also plan to continue working on it afterwards to completely solidify the entire application design.
